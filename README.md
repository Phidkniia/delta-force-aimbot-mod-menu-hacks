Delta Force Cheats Aimbot mod menu Hacks with free Delta Coins - Delta Force Helicopter landing pads are these wide, flat, paved areas with huge H-shaped markings. If you haven't seen them yet, there are some near the base camp, while most of the wilderness is ruins. Every helicopter landing pad is an important asset for you to explore and achieve your goals. The transaction behind these beautiful paved squares is that you can easily bypass the map with minimal effort. However, the helicopter will not cover the map in its forward direction (after all, this is your job). But this does not reduce the dependence on the helicopter landing pad itself. The best way to use a helicopter landing pad is when night falls. If you are trapped in the darkness, please run to the nearest helicopter landing pad and return to base camp.
